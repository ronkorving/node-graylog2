# node-graylog2

Graylog2 client library for Node.js, based on node-graylog. This
has been heavily modified to the point where there is not much left
of the original; however, this library should still be compatible
with the old one, except for configuration and the GLOBAL function setup
(some optional arguments in logging calls are not supported; they will be
logged as additional data).

** New: ** Chunked GELF is now supported.
